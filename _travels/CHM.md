<a href='https://www.cameraheritagemuseum.com'>Camera Heritage Museum</a> is located in Camera & Palette, a camera shop in Staunton, Virginia.<br />
<br />
There are over 6500 cameras. I stopped in on a slow day, and the owner gave me a bit of a tour. The cameras range from antique to quite modern. Common cameras such as Brownies all the way to Leni Riefenstahl's camera. There is a virtual tour available, which is worth a look. The shop is quite small, so it doesn't take long. There is also one of the original Star Wars lightsaber from the films, which started off life as a lighting fixture.<br />
<br />
It was definitely more interesting than I expected and a lot of interesting historical gear.
