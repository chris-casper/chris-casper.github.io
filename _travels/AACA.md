[AACA Museum](https://www.aacamuseum.org/) is a nifty fairly large car museum that is a Smithsonian affiliate. They have permanent collections as well as special collections. The first time I visited they had a Lotus exhibit. The AACA Museum is in Hershey, PA and a stone's throw from Troeg Brewery, Outlet stores, Hershey Park, Hershey's Chocolate World, etc.

Their permanent collections are the Cammack Tucker Collection, Museum of Bus Transportation, the Kissmobile and the Historic Vehicle Association (HVA) display.
