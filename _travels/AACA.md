[AACA Museum](https://www.aacamuseum.org/) is a nifty fairly large car museum that is a Smithsonian affiliate. They have permanent collections as well as special collections. The first time I visited they had a Lotus exhibit. Several of the owners were in attendance and more than thrilled to talk at length about their various vehicles. Not a shock, if you own a Lotus race car, you're not going to be shy about talking about it.  

The AACA Museum is in Hershey, PA and a stone's throw from Troeg Brewery, Outlet stores, Hershey Park, Hershey's Chocolate World, etc. Makes a nice addition to a Hershey day trip.

Their permanent collections are the Cammack Tucker Collection, Museum of Bus Transportation, the Kissmobile and the Historic Vehicle Association (HVA) display."
