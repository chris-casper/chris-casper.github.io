760,000 square feet of awesomeness.  Space Shuttle Discovery, the Enola Gay, and the Gemini 7 space capsule. And an SR-71 sits magnificantly in the exact center of the Center. The list of amazing and unique aircraft or spacecraft is quite lengthy. From the Concorde supersonic airliner to the Gondola C-49 of Goodyear Blimp Columbia. 169 aircraft and 152 large space artifacts. The plan is eventually to add up to 200 aircraft.
