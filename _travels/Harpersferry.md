Famous both for John Brown's raid and for the eight times Harper's Ferry changed hands during the Civil War. It is the point where Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia meet. As well as an important railroad junction. At the time the Civil War began, it was the only railroad link between the Northern and Southern states. Vital telegraph lines connecting Washington with points west also went through Harpers Ferry.
