<a href='https://www.maam.org'>Mid-Atlantic Air Museum</a> is most famous for their WWII weekend every year. It's fairly large regional festival, which gets incredibly crowded. They have a fairly decent permanent collection of aircraft, and are always working on restoring more. They have 22 military aircraft and 43 civilian aircraft.<br />
<br />
Their premier restoration project is a P-61 'Black Widow' night fighter. There are only four of them left in existence, worldwide. It was recovered from its crash site in Indonesia, and brought back to the United States. It took 10 years and several expeditions were needed to get the aircraft disassembled. Quite a bit of it was hauled out by helicopter.
