If you like Andy Warhol's work, well, here you go. It's the largest art museum dedicated to a single artist in North America.

The Andy Warhol Museum is 88,000-square-foot over eight floors. 17 galleries, 900 paintings, 2,000 works on paper, over 1,000 published unique prints, 77 sculptures, 4,000 photographs, and 4,350 Warhol films and videotaped works. Plus a weird collection of his personal items. They have 56 traveling exhibits they send out and about.

There's a cafe and store. Everything is very trendy and modernist.
