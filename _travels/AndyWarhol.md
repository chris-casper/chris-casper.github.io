If you like Andy Warhol's work, well, here you go. It's the largest art museum dedicated to a single artist in North America.<br />
<br />
The Andy Warhol Museum is 88,000-square-foot over eight floors. 17 galleries, 900 paintings, 2,000 works on paper, over 1,000 published unique prints, 77 sculptures, 4,000 photographs, and 4,350 Warhol films and videotaped works. Plus a weird collection of his personal items. They have 56 traveling exhibits they send out and about.<br />
<br />
There's a cafe and store. Everything is very trendy and modernist. It's five narrow, tall floors. Plan on doing a lot of stairs. I'd recommend waiting for the elevator, go to the top floor and walk down.
