Glenn Hammond Curtiss was a bit of a speed freak of the late 1800's. He started in bikes. Then motorcycles. Then engines for airships. And finally, aircraft. What later became the Curtiss-Wright Corporation, his designs set the stage for improvements in military aircraft and especially seaplanes. They definitely peaked during WW2. Now, they still exist. They're far larger but tend to stick to supplying components for other company's aircraft.

It's not the largest aircraft museum, but worth a stop by if you're in central New York. It's generally on the way if you're on the way to Buffalo. When I stopped in, it had an exhibit with props from Galaxy Quest, which was an unexpected high point.
