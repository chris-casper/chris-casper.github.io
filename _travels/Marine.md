An interesting museum. Might just be me, but the museum looks like an artillery firebase. It's supposed to invoke the flag raising on Iwo Jima. The layout is very stark and sparse on the outside. Worth visiting, but very... edited. No mention of the Banana Wars as an example. Still, lots of Marine history.
