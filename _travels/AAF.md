First off, they offer indoor tank rides. That alone is worth the trip. It has to be scheduled in advance. If you're not feeling that adventure, you can schedule to climb all over a couple tanks.<br />
<br />
It's huge. It's a 330000 square foot facility. Near 8 indoor acres. There is no heating or cooling, plan accordingly. Thankfully there are benches. There are 120 tanks and artillery pieces, 150 heavy infantry weapons, 65 types of small arms, hundreds of uniform examples. Also thousands of hats, which I'm not exactly sure why. Regardless, their museum has more armored vehicles than most countries.
