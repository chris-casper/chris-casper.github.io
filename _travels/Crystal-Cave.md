<a href='https://crystalcavepa.com'>Crystal Cave</a> is definitely more of a tourist trap sort of destination. Very family oriented, but worth a quick stop.<br />
<br />
It's one of the oldest continuously operating show caves in the US, and definitely in Pennsylvania. It was found by locals quarrying for limestone. Unfortunately, quite a bit of damage was done by locals breaking off prized pieces to take home. It was purchased and turned into a show business as much to protect it as anything else. There's currently an ice cream parlor and restaurant, miniature golf course, nature trail, second gift shop, and theater. There used to be a hotel on the premises, but was repurposed.
