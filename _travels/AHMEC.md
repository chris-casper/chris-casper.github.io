AHMEC is a small but very nice museum that has 40 civilian and military autogyros, convertiplanes and helicopters. It was fairly close to a Sikorsky aircraft plant back when I worked for them. AHMEC is one of only three museums in the world currently displaying a V-22 Osprey. It's worth visiting if you're passing through.

I managed to fix their simulator the first time I visited. And then I proceeded to crash the simulated helicopter. Quite a lot.
