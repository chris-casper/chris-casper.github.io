DAM is basically the largest art museums between the West Coast and Chicago. Very wide variety of art, with a good Native Arts collection. It got a bit generic due to that diversity, but the collection overall was definitely worth visiting if you happen to be in Denver. But I wouldn't go to Denver just for the Denver Art Museum.
