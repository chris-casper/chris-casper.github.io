Sadly most of the aircraft have been shipped off to other museums, but what remains is quite nice. They mostly have military aircraft, but good examples of a wild variety. It's worth visiting if you're just west of Philly. <br />
<br />
They have a beautiful A-10 on display that is worth the trip by itself. Every soldier has a soft spot for the A-10. Knowing they were around is like a big soft warm comfy blanket. There's no replacement in the line, and the airframes are getting quite old at this point. The USAF doesn't want a replacement either, one day that comfy warm blanket is going to go away. It'll be an unsettling day for every ground pounder.
