I was asked to give a presentation on security engineering at an antique lock show. I know, riveting stuff. Figuring they would be more interested in history rather than modern security engineering, I bridged the two. Presentation covered the early history of locks, which haven't changed much in thousands of year, up to the modern era. I also covered modern lockpicking but equally important, how to detect and prevent lockpicking.

Slide deck heavily borrowed from TOOOL official slide deck.
